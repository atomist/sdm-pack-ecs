/**
 * ECS Deployment Listener(s) can be used to augment the built-in functionality of the ECS pack. Listeners can be scheduled both before and after
 * the actual deployment process (controllable with `events` in the ECSDeploymentListenerRegistration).  These listeners can be used for anything,
 * but are particularly useful for provisioning additional resources, updating the task and service definitions programmatically, updating the URL to
 * access the application from, or any other general logic that should be run before or after an ECS deployment.
 *
 * Depending on when you schedule the listener you have different opportunities to modify behavior. When scheduled for a `before` event you will
 * be able to return an updated registration from the listener; which includes both the task and service definition.  By
 * updating this object you can modify the deployment specification using custom logic outside the pack. When you schedule a listener for an `after`
 * event, you can supply an updated `externalUrls` that will override the externalUrls the pack supplies by default.  Reasons for doing this would
 * typically be to represent your ingress machinery - ie the load balancer address and path you are putting in front of your ECS services.  In
 * addition, the `after` listener will also receive the `deployResult` object, which contains all the details of the created or
 * updated service.
